# Hackathon Submission Details

## 1. Project Information

**Project Name:** SME Financial Health AI Platform
**Problem Statement:** Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) often fail not due to a lack of business, but due to poor financial management, lack of cash flow visibility, and regulatory non-compliance. They lack access to the expensive CFO-level expertise that large corporations have.

**Solution:** 
We built an **AI-powered Financial Health Platform** that acts as a "Virtual CFO" for SMEs. It automates financial analysis by ingesting raw financial documents (CSV/PDF), uses GenAI to interpret the data, and provides:
- **Instant Financial Health Score**: Real-time assessment of risk and stability.
- **Automated Forecasting**: Deep-learning-based revenue and cash flow projections.
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Automated tracking of GST, Tax, and Labor law compliance statuses.
- **Actionable AI Insights**: Plain-language recommendations to improve profitability and reduce costs.

**Tech Stack:**
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Recharts, Glassmorphism UI
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Pandas
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI GPT-4 / Anthropic Claude (for narrative generation) & Custom Forecasting Logic
